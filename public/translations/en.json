    "about": [
      "Father, husband, and lifelong tech enthusiast who turned a passion for computers into a career. When I'm not working as a network technician, you'll find me watching anime with my family, playing video games, or kicking around a soccer ball.",
      "I've been fixing computers and figuring out how things work since I was a kid, which naturally led me into the tech world. Now I spend my days installing fiber optic networks and helping people stay connected, but I'm also working toward my Computer Science degree because I love learning new things.",
      "My perfect weekend? Playing soccer in the morning, catching up on the latest anime series, and maybe working on a coding project or two. I believe in balancing work with the things that make life funâ€”family time, good stories, and a little friendly competition on the field or in a game.",
      "Always curious, always learning, and always ready to help solve a tech problem or recommend a great anime series."
